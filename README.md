Task2
In scope of this task I've installed Docker and pulled Sergey's container loccaly which I used then as http server.
Also I learned a bit about shell scripts and created first one.
My atached script sends POST request via curl to /auth endpoint then extracts access_token from the response body into variable and
sends a GET request to /image endpoint with the authorization header and finally saves the response output to a png file. It was a picture of a pig.
During the script generation the most problematic for me was creating of expression for extracting access_token from the response and 
past it to a GET request.





#Task1
Today I was working with GitHub. I've introduced myself and added goals into the README file.
Also, I've created my first repository. During performing the first task I've watched online lessons related to the main Terminal and GIT commands.
Finally, using Terminal I've committed and pushed README changes to the GitHub account.
